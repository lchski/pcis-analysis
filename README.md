## Interesting questions

- Vacancy distribution? Which departments (directorates?), classifications, levels have more vacant positions?
- Salary distribution? Joining group / levels with salary data, what’s the average pay across different departments and directorates?
- Supervisory responsibilities?
  - Which positions oversee more and less staff (on paper)?
  - Which group / levels are more or less likely to have supervisory responsibilities? How many people supervised (direct and indirect)?
  - How many multidisciplinary reporting relationships exist? Does like group tend to report to like group?
- Org chart? How flat (or not) are different organizations?
- How do some of these questions break down geographically? How much potential for advancement (higher salaries) exist in the regions, versus the NCR? As individual contributors vs as a supervisor?
- Classification distribution? Which classifications are entirely or mostly associated with only some departments?

- interdisciplinary teams, multidisciplinary teams: are most teams by classification, or are they mixed? which classifications are more often mixed than not?
- size of teams, what's the # reporting in total to each group / level combo, NCR vs not?
- how much does each department's strat pol team (or corporate services, etc etc) cost?—based on portfolio size, how much money each department has
- variation in titles versus group / levels—e.g., what's a "Director" (often abbreviated to "Dir" in data) in different spots?

NB: For most, probably best to focus on "Occupied" positions only—as many "Vacant" positions may just be placeholders. (Would be good to surface some of the dynamics of classification etc that cause this.)

The report should contain the following fields: department, position number, classification, job title - English, job title - French, job number, supervisor position number, supervisor classification, province, geographic location, branch, previous classification, reason, int. type, sup. factor, evaluation process, auth., effective date, auth. date, rev. date, NOC, vacancy, coordinates by factor (coord1 to coord16), points by factor (points1 to points16), and total points.

### A-2021-00256

> Provide a current (2021) report in MS Excel format (.xls or .xlsx) from the Position Classification Information System (PCIS+) that includes every position from all departments in an occupational group represented by the PSAC (that is, AS, CM, CR, DA, IS, OE, OM, PM, ST, WP, FR, GL, GS, HP, HS, LI, PR-S, SC, DD, EG, GT, PI, PY, TI, ED, EU, LS, and FB). For greater clarity, the following information fields are requested: department, position number, classification, Title - English, Title - French, job number, supervisor position number, supervisor classification, province, geographic location, branch, previous classification, reason, int. type, sup. factor, evaluation process, auth., effective date, auth. date, rev. date, NOC, vacancy, coordinates by factor (coord1 to coord16), points by factor (points1 to points16), and total points.

### A-2022-01430

> Database schema of the Position Classification Information System (PCIS+) describing the tables and fields in the database and a legend for any columns with coded values (e.g., the "Reason for classification decision" column in the list of current positions has values A through R; please provide a legend explaining what these coded values mean). Relevant record / bank numbers, per Info Source: TBS PM 236, TBS PCE 784. See previous ATI A-2021-00256, which included a legend tab in the response. I would like a schema describing all the tables and columns in the database, and a legend as seen in A-2021-00256 for any columns that use coded values. Please provide records digitally, in machine-readable format (e.g., MS Excel format, .xls or .xlsx, or .csv) where possible, for accessibility reasons.
