## exploration

### understand how many different trees there are in an org
### more trees = likely more created / inferred positions, or broken reporting chains
### NB: makes sense that DND and RCMP are so many, since their positions would include RMs / CAF that aren't stored in PCIS

## analysis

### study a particular organization
positions_graph %>%
  filter(organization_code == "IMC") %>%
  select(
    position_gid,
    grp_lvl = position_classification_code,
    branch_directorate_division,
    position_title_english,
    sup_pos_gid = supervisor_gid,
    sup_grp_lvl = supervisors_position_classification_code,
    position_status,
    reports_direct:last_col()
  ) %>%
  as_tibble %>% View

### study a position of interest
positions_graph %>%
  mutate(distance_to_position_of_interest = node_distance_to(position_gid == "TBD-2986")) %>%
  filter(position_status == "Occupied") %>%
  filter(distance_to_position_of_interest != Inf) %>%
  select(
    position_gid,
    grp_lvl = position_classification_code,
    branch_directorate_division,
    position_title_english,
    sup_pos_gid = supervisor_gid,
    sup_grp_lvl = supervisors_position_classification_code,
    position_status,
    reports_direct:last_col()
  ) %>%
  as_tibble %>% View()

### reporting responsibilities
positions_graph %>%
  as_tibble %>%
  group_by(
    # is_central_agency = organization_code %in% c("PCO", "TBD", "FIN"), # or other axis of interest, e.g., NCR vs not
    is_ncr = work_location_english %in% c("Ottawa", "Gatineau", "Hull"),
    grp_lvl = position_classification_code
  ) %>%
  summarize(
    count = n(),
    max_direct = max(reports_direct),
    min_direct = min(reports_direct),
    avg_direct = mean(reports_direct),
    max_indirect = max(reports_indirect),
    min_indirect = min(reports_indirect),
    avg_indirect = mean(reports_indirect)
  ) %>%
  mutate(across(where(is.numeric), ~ round(.x, 1))) %>%
  arrange(grp_lvl)

### accuracy of supervisory factor code, vs classified org chart?
### verdict: `supervisory_factor_code` seems barely used
positions_graph %>%
  as_tibble %>%
  group_by(is_supervisor) %>%
  count_prop(supervisory_factor_code)

### look at CDS (because it's what I know)
positions_graph %>%
  mutate(distance_to_position_of_interest = node_distance_to(position_gid == "TBD-2986")) %>%
  filter(distance_to_position_of_interest != Inf | branch_directorate_division == "Canadian Digital Ser")
#### what can we observe? that there are clearly some broken links in the chain: sometimes you can go by shared root node, but sometimes there are positions with the same branch/dir/div that are floating



## visualization
## NB: don't try to run on whole graph... unless you want to stress your computer
##     works best for orgs / clusters roughly <600
##     now if we could get a dynamic / zooming visualization...
